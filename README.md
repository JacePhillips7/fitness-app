<h1>Workout Tracker App</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

This app was created as a side project to help track my performance and goals as I resumed working out. After searching for existing apps that met my needs, I found none that were both suitable and affordable. So, I decided to build my own using Expo!

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To run the app locally, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

    Node.js (version 18 or later)
    Expo CLI

<h3>Installation</h3>

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/JacePhillips7/fitness-app
    cd <my-app>

Install dependencies:

bash

    npm install

<h3>Env</h3>

Make a .env file in the my-app directory
Follow the example in the .example.env file

    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
This is required for firebase

I might make this optional later, and save all data on device.

<h3>Running the App</h3>

You can run the app on different platforms using the following commands:

For web:

    npm run web

For Android:

    npm run android

For iOS:

    npm run ios

Once the app is running, you can start tracking your workouts and setting goals. The interface is designed to be intuitive, so you can easily navigate and use the features.
